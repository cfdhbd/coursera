Q1: When we talk about "spikes", we are referring to the change in some property of the neuron over time. When we typically plot a spike, the x-axis represents time. What does the y-axis represent?

A: voltage

_______________________________________________________________________________
Q2:A ircuit diagram representing a piece of neuronal cell membrane, the battery, resistor, and capacitor are roughly analogous to the ___, ___, and ___ respectively.

A:
battery = ion gradient
resistor = ion channel
capacitor = lipid bilayer

Q3: Let's imagine there is another ion that is relevant to determining a neuron's membrane potential in addition to those discussed in the lecture. We'll call the ion Im+ (for Imaginary). The equilibrium potential of Im+ (EIm) is -100 mV. Assume the resting potential of the neuron is -65 mV. When specialized Im+ channels open, the Im+ conductance will increase. This will ___ the cell, thus ___ its membrane potential.

A: depolarize, decreasing

Q4:Suppose Im+ channels are composed of 5 subunits that open and close independently, as well as an additional "ball-in-socket" gating mechanism. Each of the 5 subunits has a voltage-dependent open probability u and closed probability (1−u), while the ball-in-socket gating mechanism has a voltage-dependent open probability z and closed probability (1−z). Which expression could most likely be used to express the Im+ current across the membrane?

A: I{Im}=g{Im}*(1−u)^5*(1−z)*(V−EIm)

Q5: picture of graph, involving time constant. the one with the smaller time constant
will be the first to reach steady state.

A: m

Q6: Na+ current depolarizes the cell and is the principal driver for the upward portion of a spike. Both m and h must be high for there to be a lot of Na+ current. h∞ becomes 0 when voltage is close to or greater than -30 mV. How, then, is it possible for the membrane to depolarize beyond V = -30 mV during a spike (spikes peak closer to V = 40 mV)?

A: τh is high relative to τm, so h does not reach h∞ fast enough to block the spike.

Q7:True or false: All neural coding can essentially be reduced to variations in firing rate. This allows the information in complex spiking patterns to be summarized in a "rate code."

A: True

Q8: Recall the exponential integrate and fire neuron model, schematized above. How many stable fixed points does the system have?

A: 1

Q9:The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a 2-dimensional dynamical neuron model. It is defined by the following two differential equations:

dVdt=V(a−V)(V−1)−w+I
dwdt=bV−cw

where V is voltage, w represents an outward hyperpolarizing current, I is injected current, and a, b, and c are constants.

Which of the following is an expression for the w-nullcline?

A: w = bV/c

Q10: The above figure is a phase plane based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model from the previous question. A vector field is shown that gives a sense of the flow of the system. If we observe a spike in this system, the trajectory will travel counterclockwise around the phase plane. The first part, or “upstroke,” of the spike occurs in which of the following regions of the phase plane (regions are labeled in the figure)?


A: (A) because it is angled from 0 to 90 deg
