Q2
Suppose we are diagnosing a very rare illness, which happens only once in 100 million people on average. Luckily, we have a test for this illness but it is not perfectly accurate. If somebody has the disease, it will report positive 99% of the time. If somebody does not have the disease, it will report positive 2% of the time.

Suppose a patient walks in and tests positive for the disease. Using the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion, would we diagnose them positive?

A: yes


Q3
what if we used the maximum a posteriori criterion?

A: No (because the disease is extremely unlikely)


Q4
why do we see a difference between the two criteria, if there is one?

A: the role of prior probability!
